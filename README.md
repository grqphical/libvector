# libvector - A library with Vector types for linear algebra

[![Build & Tests](https://github.com/grqphical/libvector/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/grqphical/libvector/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## Functional Goals

1. Create basic Vector types
   - Create a 2D, 3D, 4D and dynamic length Vector types
   - Create a trait for the Vector types with common methods such as dot products and magnitudes
2. Implement basic operations
   - Implement basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
3. Implement conversions to and from arrays/tuples
   - Implement conversions to and from arrays and tuples, of the same length, for the Vector types
4. Create a macro to create custom Vector structs
   - Macro should create a Vector struct with the specified length and implement the Vector trait

## Usage

Include the library in your project by adding the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
libvector = { git = "https://github.com/grqphical/libvector.git" }
```

Then you are able to access the Vector types and methods in your project:

```rust
use libvector::{Vector, Vector2};

fn main() {
    let v1 = Vector2::new(1.0, 2.0);
    let v2 = Vector2::new(3.0, 4.0);

    let dot = v1.dot(v2);
    println!("Dot product: {}", dot);
}
```

### Using the `vector!` macro

libvector comes with a powerful macro to create custom Vector types with a specified length. This can be used to create custom Vector types while
still having all operations complete in **O(1)** time complexity. It creates a struct called `VectorN` where `N` is the specified length.

```rust
use libvector::{Vector, vector};

vector!(5);

fn main() {
    let v5 = Vector5::new(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0);
}
```

### Dynamic length Vectors

libvector also comes with a `DynamicVector` struct that allows for a custom length Vector. This struct is not as efficient as the fixed length Vectors
generated by `vector!` however if you have a large amount of fields or do not wish to use macros in your code, this struct is available.

```rust
use libvector::{Vector, DynamicVector};

fn main() {
    let v = DynamicVector::new(5);
    v.set(0, 1.0);
    v.set(1, 2.0);

    let dot = v.dot(&v);
}
```
